# To Do Lists

## 22/3/2021
### For me
* Check predictive log-likelihood for LAVI and CoGAPS.
* Look at the 2 real datasets from [Doubly Nonparametric Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Based on Dependent Indian Buffet Processes, Xuan et al (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7896614) and [Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Dirichlet Process Mixtures, Li et al (2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121775).
  * Try understand how they used these datasets and produced results.
  * Try see if I can apply my algorithm to these datasets.
  
  

### For HJ
* Check (email) implementation for [Doubly Nonparametric Sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Based on Dependent Indian Buffet Processes, Xuan et al (2018)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7896614) and [Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorization With Dirichlet Process Mixtures, Li et al (2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9121775).
