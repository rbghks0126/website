# Testing

We model the observed data using a mixture of three binomial distributions. We assume the observations $X_1, X_2,..., X_{300}$ are independent to each other, and each $X_i$ follows this mixture model:,
    \[
    Z_i \sim \mbox{categorical }(\pi_1, \pi_2, 1-\pi_1-\pi_2),
    \]
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    X_i | Z_i = 1 &\sim \mbox{Binomial}(20, p_1),\\
    X_i | Z_i = 2 &\sim \mbox{Binomial}(20, p_2),\\
    X_i | Z_i = 3 &\sim \mbox{Binomial}(20, p_3).
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    The binomial distribution has probability mass function (for fixed 20 trials):
    \[
    f(x;p) = {20\choose x} p^x (1-p)^{20-x}.
    \]
    
We aim to obtain MLE of parameters $\theta = (\pi_1, \pi_2, p_1, p_2, p_3)$ using the EM algorithm.
